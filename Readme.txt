In this I generated the risk map based on the crime rate and implemented a heuristic search algorithm to find an optimal path between two coordinates on the map.

The A* implementation is present in MainProject.ipynb
An implementation of best first search with admissible heuristic is present in Bonus1.ipynb
I also worked on future scope of project and implemented a Random Heuristic.

What is requirement for running project:
Libraries:Pyshp,Geopandas,Pandas,Numpy,Sklearn,Matplotlib

Where it is tested:
Ubuntu 18.04

Which version of python:
version>=3.5

How to run:
1)Ensure all required files are in one folder:shape and ipynb
2)Open in jupyter notebook
3)Set the gridsize and threshold in the 1st cell of notebook
4)Execute each cell one by one to get output
5)Sometime there is some malfunction due to kernel .So just restart if something does not show or is stuck.
